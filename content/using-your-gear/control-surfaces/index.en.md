Ardour supports a variety of controls surfaces that provide convenient hardware interface for accessing program's features. Here are some of them:

- PreSonus FaderPort 2/8/16
- Solid State Logic 360 UF8
- Steinberg CC121
- Novation Control LX
- Contour Design Shuttle

Control surfaces that have dedicated configuration pages, such as the ones listed above, get enabled in Ardour automatically as soon as you attach them to a computer running Ardour. After that, go to `Edit > Preferences > Control Surfaces`, select the device of interest, and click **Show Protocol Settings** below.

For documentation specific to those surfaces, please read the relevant chapters of the [user manual](https://manual.ardour.org/using-control-surfaces/).

Control surfaces that have dedicated integration do not need enabling manually. Just plug them in and start using immediately.
